#### What I would've done if I had had a bit more time
- Decouple libraries (dto-based library, app-based library). It will allow smoothly integrate with other microservices
- using feign
- cache
- more layers
- multiple subscriptions (to see the history) / subscriptions history
- Set IDs on my own (instead of lettting spring and DB do that)
- More detailed exceptions
